* Hardhat framework <br/>
I use hardhat framework to develop and unit test smart contract.
Hardhat framework is an Ethereum development environment. Using this framework, we can compile the smart contracts and run them on devnet. And also can have unit test before deployment.
Finally, I deploy and verify the smart contract using its function.

* Visual Studio Code <br/>
Very powerful and useful code editor. I use this editor to develop all kinds of programs like solidity, rust, javascript, typescript, etc.
